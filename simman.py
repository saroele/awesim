This module contains tools to:
    1) access simulation parameters and results generated by dymola in 
       .mat files, or having exactly the same structure
    2) keep track of a (unlimited) amount of these simulation output files

Three classes are defined:
    1) Simulation
    2) Simdex
    3) Process

The main properties of those classes are discussed below.
One function is also defined: load_simdex(filename).  This function loads the
desired simdex that was previously saved with Simdex.save(filename)

class Simulation:
-----------------
    Class for doing operations one 1 single simulation file
    The simualation files are supposed to be generated by Dymola, or at 
    least have the same structure.  
    A Simulation object contains all the (useful) info that is in the .mat file.
    Therefore, objects of the Simulation class are relatively memory intensive,
    depending on the size of the .mat file.
    
    Most important attributes are:
        - self.filename (path to the .mat file)
        - self.names (list of all variable and parameter names)
        - self.dataInfo (mapping of vars and pars to data1 and data2)
        - self.data1 (contains the values of the parameters)
        - self.data2 (contains the values of the variables (timeseries))
    
    Most important methods are:
        - get_value(name) : retreives the value(s) for name, name can be 
          a parameter or a variable
        - exist(regex) : returns all vars and pars that satisfy the regex
        
class Simdex:
-------------
    A Simdex object is an index of all the parameters and variables in several 
    .mat files.  It can be used to select a set of .mat files from a large set
    in order to analyse the results of this set of simulations.
    
    Most important attributes are:
        - self.simulations (a list of filenames of the indexed simulations)
        - self.parameters (a list of all parameters in the set of simulations)
        - self.parametermap (numpy array mapping which simulation has 
          which parameters)        
        - self.parametervalues (numpy array containing the values of the 
          mapped parameters)
        - self.variables (a list of all variables in the set of simulations)
        - self.variablemap (numpy array mapping which simulation has 
          which variables)
        - self.filterset (dictionary tracking all executed filter options on 
          the current set) 
          
        There is no attribute containing the variable values themselves because 
        that would blow up the size of simdex.  These values are kept in the 
        original .mat files and only extracted when needed

Most important methods (* = implemented):

    * __init__(folder): create simdex based from all .mat simulation files in 
      the current folder
    - update(folderlist): update simdex with all .mat files found in a list of 
      folders. Checks if the found files are already in simulations, else they 
      are added and their parameters and ALL attributes are updated with the 
      info found in the new files
    * remove(sim_id): remove a simulation from the simdex
    * print(): gives a nice overview of the indexed simulations 
    * filter(dictionary): this method takes as input a dictionary with parameter
      name/value pairs.   It returns a new Simdex object with those simulations
      that have exactly the same values for those parameters.  
      If a parameter is asked with '*' as value, all simulations that HAVE 
      the parameter are selected.
    * getidentical(sim_id):  this method takes as input a simulation number and 
      returns a new simdex object all simulations with identical parameter set 
      (so all variants of the model with only changed parameter values).  
    * exist(re): similar to Simulation.exist method. Give a search string as re 
      (regular expression) and you get a list of all parameters and variables 
      that satisfy the re. 
    * plot(var): directly create a plot showing the given var for each of the 
      simulations in self.
    - get_values(var or par): get an array with the values of the variable or
      parameter for each of the simulations in the simdex
    * get_parameter(par): to be merged in get_values!!
    * save(filename): saves the simdex by pickling (cPickle) to filename.  The 
      simdex can be loaded later on with the function load_simdex(filename). 
      This is no method of the class Simdex, so to be imported separately from
      this module
      
This info AND more details can be found in the docstrings of each of these
classes, functions and methods

        A difference is made between single line assignments (x = ...) 
        and multiline statements (if ...).  
        Therefore, the pp string can be multiline,
        and multistatements.  The distinction is made based on the second item
        after doing a pp.split(' '):
            - if it is a '=', the pp-string is an assignement and is processed 
              like that
            - else, a different syntax is applied cause the spaces in the 
              multiline expression can be of syntactic importance.  
              I still have to develop this, and the point that I didn't solve 
              yet is the attribution of the result.  If you have a string like
              if a>0:
                  b=1
              else:
                  b=2
              you have to check each line, replace a and b with their full names
              (in case of mothers) and recompose the multiline string with the 
              same spaces. Surrounding each variable name with eg '$' could be
              a good solution.  
                
        the multline thing is not implemented yet.

class Simdex:
    """
    A Simdex object is an index of all the parameters, variables and 
    post-processing results in several .mat files.  
    It is used to treat different result files with a single or different 
    Process objects and keep the full processed results.
    Methods for easy filtering of the set of simulations are provided.
    
    The variables are stored in an h5 file.  Parameters are only stored locally
    in the attributes of the simdex object. When a filter is applied to a
    simdex, the resulting subset of simulations uses the same h5 file, so 
    there is no unnecessary copying of big files on the hard drive.
        
    Overview of most important attributes :
        - self.simulations: a list with unique ID's (SID) of the simulations
        - self.parameters: a list of all parameters in the set of simulations.
          The parameters are listed here with their FULL names
        - self.parametermap: numpy array mapping which simulation has 
          which parameters     
        - self.parametervalues: numpy array containing the values of the 
          mapped parameters
        - self.variables: a list of all variables in the set of simulations. 
          The variables are listed here with their FULL names.
        - self.variablemap: numpy array mapping which simulation has 
          which variables
        - self.filterset: dictionary tracking all executed filter options on 
          the current set
        - self.vardic (optional): a mapping of shortname:longname pairs for 
          variables
        - self.pardic (optional) a mapping of shortname:longname pairs for 
          parameters
          
        
    Most important methods (* = implemented):

    * __init__(folder): create simdex based from all .mat simulation files 
      in the current folder
    - update(folderlist): update simdex with all .mat files found in a list of 
      folders. Checks if the found files are already in simulations, else they 
      are added and their parameters and ALL attributes are updated with the 
      info found in the new files
    * remove(sim_id): remove a simulation from the simdex
    * print(): gives a nice overview of the indexed simulations 
    * filter(dictionary): this method takes as input a dictionary with parameter 
      name/value pairs.   It returns a new Simdex object with those simulations
      that have exactly the same values for those parameters.  
      If a parameter is asked with '*' as value, all simulations that HAVE 
      the parameter are selected.
    * getidentical(sim_id):  this method takes as input a simulation number and 
      returns a new simdex object all simulations with identical parameter set 
      (so all variants of the model with only changed parameter values).  
    * exist(re): similar to Simulation.exist method. Give a search string as re 
      (regular expression) and you get a list of all parameters and variables 
      that satisfy the re. 
    * plot(var): directly create a plot showing the given var for each of the 
      simulations in self.
    - get_values(var or par): get an array with the values of the variable or
      parameter for each of the simulations in the simdex
    * get_parameter(par): to be merged in get_values!!
    - save(filename): saves the simdex by pickling (cPickle) to filename.  The 
      simdex can be loaded later on with the function load_simdex(filename)
      
    FEATURES:
    - all found .mat files are tested.  If they to not have the structure of
      a dymola simulation result, they are not indexed

    Important CONVENTIONS:
        - we make a distinction between parameters (one single value)
          and variables (a timeseries of values)
        - simulation identity (SID) is a string with format SIDxxxx
            
    Possible IMPROVEMENTS:
    - multi folder file search
    - support multiple filter (well, it's possible, but the filtersets will 
      become a bit messed up (last filterset overwrites existing filterset if 
      it has the same keys)
